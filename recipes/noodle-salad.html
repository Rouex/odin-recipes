    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This Vietnamese-style noodle salad is my 'too hot to cook' staple.<br />It
      is bursting with flavor and makes great use of leftover grilled meat or
      shrimp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lime really brings a nice tartness to the dressing. I would have
      preferred a thicker dressing,<br />
      so it would have coated the salad and noodles better. It was very watery,
      and just fell to the bottom of the plate.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package (linguine-width) rice noodles</li>
      <li>2 cups thinly sliced Napa (Chinese) cabbage</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups matchstick-cut carrots</li>
      <li>8 ounces grilled shrimp</li>
      <li>1 cup bean sprouts</li>
      <li>½ English cucumber, halved lengthwise and cut into thin slices</li>
      <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 ⅔ tablespoons chopped fresh mint</li>
      <li>2 ⅔ tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>2 ⅔ tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
      <li>½ cup coarsely chopped peanuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk water, lime juice, fish sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and
        Sriracha together in a bowl until the sugar is dissolved.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a full boil; remove from heat and soak
        rice noodles in the hot water for 1 minute. Stir to separate the noodles
        and continue soaking until the noodles are tender, about 3 minutes more.
        Drain noodles and rinse with cold water until cooled. Shake noodles in
        colander to drain as much water as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix noodles, cabbage, carrots, shrimp, bean sprouts, cucumber slices,
        green onions, mint, cilantro, and basil together in a large bowl.
        Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Top with chopped
        Nuts.

    </ol>
